# 1) Create a class named `Vehicle`.
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage):
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage


modelx = Vehicle(240, 18)
modely = Vehicle(280, 13)
print(modelx.max_speed, modely.max_speed)
print(modelx.mileage, modely.mileage)
# 2) Inside the class, define the constructor method `__init__(self, max_speed, mileage)`:
#    a) This method runs automatically when an object of the class is created.
#    b) It takes two inputs: `max_speed` and `mileage`.

# 3) Store the passed values inside the object using instance variables:
#    a) Assign `self.max_speed = max_speed`
#    b) Assign `self.mileage = mileage`

# 4) Create an object of the `Vehicle` class named `modelX`
#    by passing values for max speed and mileage: `Vehicle(240, 18)`.

# 5) Access the object’s instance variables and print them:
#    a) Print `modelX.max_speed` as the model’s max speed.
#    b) Print `modelX.mileage` as the model’s mileage.
